  pip install "camel-ai[all]==0.2.10"
```

### üì• Completing configuration

First we need to change some environment variables to replace our own API. Open the `config.py` file in the root directory and fill in the following variables. That is:

- `os.environ["FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"] = "YOUR API"`: Replace `YOUR API` with the API_KEY of the firecrawl you got
- `knowledge = firecrawl.crawl(url="Knowledge base URL")`: Replace `Knowledge base URL` with the address of the crawled knowledge base
- `api_key="YOUR API"`: Replace `YOUR API` with the model API you got

```python
# config.py
os.environ["FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"] = "YOUR API"
os.makedirs('local_data', exist_ok=True)
firecrawl = Firecrawl()
knowledge = firecrawl.crawl(url="Knowledge base URL")
with open('local_data/qdrant_overview.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write(knowledge["data"][0]["markdown"])
qwen_model = ModelFactory.create(
            model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL,
            model_type="Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct", 
            api_key="YOUR API",
            url="Model path",
            model_config_dict=QwenConfig(temperature=0.2).as_dict(),
        )
agent = ChatAgent(
            system_message="You're a helpful assistant",
            message_window_size=10,
            model=qwen_model
        )
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Prepare config information

A simple example is as follows. In a text exchange, we only need to pay attention to:

- `single_chat_prefix`: In a personal chat, the content starting with single_chat_prefix needs to trigger the bot; 
- `single_chat_reply_prefix`: The bot replies are prefixed with "[bot] "to distinguish real people. 
- `group_name_white_list`: In a group chat, the group name can be set to group_name_white_list. To apply to all group chats, enter "group_name_white_list": ["ALL_GROUP"]

Other configuration details, please see https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat?tab=readme-ov-file

# config.json

  "linkai_app_code": ""                                      
}
```



### üéÆ Start Running

Now we can run `app.py`

```bash
	python app.py
```

You'll see a QR code pop up. You can scan the code and confirm the login to wechat, and wechat will be treated as a wechat robot, and when we send a message to the wechat, we will automatically receive a reply.



### üîßÔ∏è Notes

If you encounter other problems, please confirm the followingÔºö

1. Wechat robot accounts only support real-name authentication accounts. Or you will encounter errors about `wxsid`.
2. Using proxy networks or some public networks may experience `request` errors.
